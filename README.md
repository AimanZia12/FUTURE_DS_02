# FUTURE_DS_02
This is a SOCIAL MEDIA CAMPAIGN PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS done using a Power BI. This dashboard helps in understanding its important insights. I worked on Marketing Performance Analytics Dataset and created a dashboard through which one can understand useful insights and also use these insights for future improvement in marketing. 
The Marketing Performance Analytics Dashboard provides comprehensive insights into a company’s marketing performance. It helps decision-makers evaluate ROI, optimize marketing channels, and understand regional and product-based performance.

## Key Features-
•	Total Revenue: Summed up the revenue generated from all marketing channels and campaigns across the dataset.

•	Total Clicks: Sum of all user clicks generated across marketing campaigns, indicating the total engagement received from ad impressions.

•	Total Conversions: Total number of successful actions completed by users as a result of marketing efforts across all channels.

•	Average ROI: measured the overall efficiency of marketing spend by calculating the average return generated per unit of ad spend using the formula.
Average ROI = (Total Revenue – Total Ad Spend) / Total Ad Spend × 100
It reflects the profitability of marketing campaigns.

•	Average CPC: (Cost Per Click) indicates the average amount spent to get a single click on an ad, calculated using the formula:
Average CPC = Total Ad Spend / Total Clicks
It helps evaluate the cost-efficiency of marketing campaigns.

•	Average CTR (Click-Through Rate) measures the percentage of users who clicked on an ad after seeing it, calculated using the formula:
Average CTR = (Total Clicks / Total Impressions) × 100
It reflects how effective the ads are at capturing user attention.

•	Channel Performance: Evaluated the effectiveness of each marketing channel by comparing key metrics such as Impressions, Clicks, Conversions, CTR, CPC, ROI, and Revenue. This helps identify which platforms deliver the best results and where to optimize marketing spend.

•	Region Analysis: Examines marketing performance across different geographic locations by comparing metrics like Leads, Conversions, Revenue, and ROI. It helps identify high-performing regions and areas needing strategic improvements.

•	Product Insights: Analyze the performance of individual products based on metrics such as Leads, Conversions, Revenue, and ROI, helping identify top-performing products and those that may require marketing adjustments.

•	Quarterly Trends: track the performance of marketing metrics—such as Ad Spend, Clicks, Conversions, Revenue, and ROI—over each quarter. This helps identify seasonal patterns, growth opportunities, and areas for optimization across time.
